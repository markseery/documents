Introduction

Based on the 600+ takeaways mined from the recent Autocon 1 conference, here is one potential step-by-step guide to a network automation journey. There will be debate about some of this, for example some will say forgo the strategy and executive by-in, get started, and ask for forgiveness later. Prove the value first. Some might also say start with AI today. These are all worthy conversations to have, and I will for sure entertain some of these ideas in future blogs.

Preparation and planning

Define clear automation strategy and goals. 
Identify impactful use cases that deliver business value. 
Secure management buy-in by articulating the value of automation. 
Allocate budget and resources for automation initiatives

Build foundation

Start with device inventory management (e.g., using NetBox). 
Establish programmatic access to devices (e.g., using Netmiko)
Implement version control for configurations and scripts. 
Create a trusted source of truth for network data

Skill development

Upskill network engineers in basic programming (start with Python)
Introduce agile practices and DevOps principles
Foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge sharing.
 Encourage participation in network automation communities and forums

Start small

Begin with automating simple, repetitive tasks
Use configuration templates (e.g., Jinja) for consistency. 
Implement basic workflow automation (e.g., device queries, config checks). 
Focus on quick wins to demonstrate value

Expand scope

Develop modular, reusable automation components
Implement more advanced workflows and orchestration. 
Integrate with existing systems (monitoring, ticketing, etc.). 
Start automating more complex tasks (e.g., network provisioning)

Implement testing and quality assurance

Develop a comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, system). 
Use tools like pytest for writing and parameterizing tests
Implement pre-deployment and post-deployment testing. 
Create virtual lab environments for safe testing

Standardization and best practices

Develop coding standards and best practices
Implement peer review processes for automation code. 
Create documentation for all automation processes. 
Standardize APIs and data models across the network

Scale and optimize

Implement CI/CD pipelines for automation code
Develop a centralized automation platform or framework
Optimize resource allocation and utilization. 
Implement network reconciliation and auto-checks

Advanced automation

Explore AI and machine learning for network operations
Implement intent-based networking principles
Develop self-healing network capabilities.
Integrate network automation with broader IT automation efforts

Continuous improvement

Regularly review and update automation strategies. 
Gather feedback from users and stakeholders. 
Stay updated on new tools and technologies. 
Contribute to open-source projects and share knowledge with the community

What works for you

Remember to adapt this plan based on your company's specific needs, existing infrastructure, and resources. 
Start small, focus on delivering value, and gradually expand your automation efforts as you gain experience and maturity.
